Gaming
Design a game or gaming platform on Tezos that leverages the benefits of Web3 such as open economies,
true ownership, and interoperability, to create a new paradigm of gaming experiences for players and
developers.

PS1:
Build a dice-rolling game. A group of people initially (invite only) will join in, guess a number from the range
[1, 6], and then put a bet upon their guess. The one who guesses the output correctly is treated as the
winner(s). Then the entire pool of bets automatically gets distributed across these winner(s). The main
challenge here is to generate a perfectly random number in the given range (of course on-chain) so as to
avoid any misleads. Once this is achieved, a complete section of games can be further built upon this
random module.
